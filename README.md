## Project Description:

Capstone Project from the Udemy course: Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide.

This is a project creating a [KickStarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) style application. The application's core functionality is built into a Solidity Smart Contract, which is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

### Key outcomes:

- Developed a multi-page next.js application to that interacts with a Solidity Smart Contract deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain
- Used multiple tools relating to Smart Contract development like RemixIDE, Infura and Web3.
- Used the semantic-UI library to speed up development of front end interface.
- Worked with class based React components and then refactored to functional components to learn how to use hooks in React.
- Leveraged the mocha testing framework to develop fault tolerent code.
